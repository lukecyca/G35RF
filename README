Arduino library for using the RF remote/receiver that comes with G35 Christmas lights.

Teardown
--------
Open the green controller box attached to the string of lights. Mine had triangular
security screws, but I was able to jam a flathead in there and turn them out. The
receiver board is a tiny circuit board that must be desoldered from the main board.

Setup
-----
The receiver board takes GND and VCC (3.3V). It also needs a small length of wire
connected as an antenna. The DATA pin gets connected to pin 2 of your Arduino Uno.
Technically you should level-shift this to 5V, but I had success without shifting.
